# Chatbot-RAG-Vector-Database
This project implements an adaptive chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating personalized recommendations based on user inputs. It combines the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language understanding with a vector database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
